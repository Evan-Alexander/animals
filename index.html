                <p>These guys are born hunters.  They are also very stubborn.  Trying to train a fox terrier is an uphill battle.  But they are really loving and loyal, as long as their not on the 'hunt'.</p>

                <h1>Doberman Pinschers</h1>
                <p>Dobermans have to be one of the most misunderstood breeds out there.  While they're known as a 'gaurd dog,' they are some of the most loving, loyal, and smartest of any breed.</p>

                <h1>Boxers</h1>
                <p>Boxers have lots of character.  They may look tough, but they have a lot of heart and are extremely loyal to their owners.  They are easily trainable.  Just watch out for that drool!</p>

                <h1>Border Collies</h1>
                <p>Border Collies are a herding dog.  They like to be in control and prefer to always have a task to complete.  They're great frisbee dogs, easily trainable, and require loads of attention.</p>
